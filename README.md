This project consists of several folders and files:

- **dataset**: Contains data related to the project. It is further divided into:
  - **source**: Contains additional information about the UNSW-NB15 dataset.
  - **used**: Contains the UNSW-NB15 dataset used in this project.

- **plot**: Includes the `performance_plot.ipynb` file, which is used to generate performance comparison plots for the report. It relies on results from the `supervised_learning` and `unsupervised_learning` folders.

- **references**: Contains the references and literature used in the report.

- **supervised_learning** and **unsupervised_learning**: These folders represent separate experiments, each containing individual subfolders. Inside each experiment's subfolder, there is a `csvs` directory that stores the experiment results.

- **utils**: This folder contains utility functions that may be used in the experiments to simplify code and enhance code readability.

- **config.py**: This file contains configuration settings, mainly related to file paths.
